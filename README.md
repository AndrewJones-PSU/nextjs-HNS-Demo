# Blockchain@PSU Handshake Demo Workshop
This repository contains a simple website created using NextJS. This README is meant as a guide on how to create this simple website as well as hosting it on Vercel and connecting it to a Handshake domain.

This project was made for Blockchain@PSU's 2nd Handshake workshop.

## 1 - Initializing NextJS + Creating the Project

First, make sure you have git installed to your computer and you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. You'll need to use github in order to connect your project with Vercel. You can also use GitLab or BitBucket, but for this demonstration we'll use GitHub.

Next, we'll install NextJS to our system. To do this, we'll first need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Click the link, download the LTS/Recommended version, and install it.

TODO: add path settings stuff + rest of documentation
